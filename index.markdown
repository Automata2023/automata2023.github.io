## Conference Info

The 29th International Workshop on Cellular Automata and Discrete Complex Systems will take place between August 30, 2023 and September 1, 2023 at the [University of Trieste](https://www.units.it) in Italy

These Automata workshops aim to Establish and maintain a permanent, international, multidisciplinary forum for the collaboration of researchers in the field of Cellular Automata (CA) and Discrete Complex Systems (DCS) while providing a platform for presenting and discussing new ideas and results.

These workshops support the development of theory and applications of CA and DCS (e.g. parallel computing, physics, biology, social sciences, and others) and to
identify and study within an interdisciplinary and multidisciplinary context, the important fundamental aspects, concepts, notions and problems concerning CA and DCS.

The AUTOMATA series is the official annual event of [IFIP WG 1.5](https://ifipwg15.inria.fr/), the Working Group 5 (on Cellular Automata and Discrete Complex Systems), of the Technical Committee 1 (on Foundations of Computer Science), of the [International Federation for Information Processing (IFIP)](https://ifip.org/).
