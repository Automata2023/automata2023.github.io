_Invited talk:_ __Sandpile models and P-completeness__

Sandpile models are number conserving cellular automata, where grains  move from cell to cell according to local rules. On finite grids it has  a beautiful algebraic structure with a mysterious identity element. The  "complexity" of such models can be studied through the algorithmic  hardness of predicting the dynamics, which is feasible in polynomial  time simply by simulating the whole stabilization process of grains  move. From a theoretical point of view, whether it is possible or not to  do better, i.e. predict sandpiles in logarithmic time on parallel  machines (PRAM), is still open. This corresponds to the complexity class  NC (Nick's Class), which is not known to be equal or differ from P  (neither to be equal of differ from NP), hence there is a notion of  P-completeness. We will discuss circuit value problem (CVP, the canonical P-complete problem), its variants and connections with  sandpiles. All this will be presented while playing with a sandpile 
simulator.
