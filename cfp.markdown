## Call for Papers

### Scope

Papers presenting original and unpublished research on all fundamental aspects of cellular automata (CA), affine/correlated models of automata (such as automata networks, finite automata over finite/infinite words, picture languages), and related discrete complex systems (DCS) are sought.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
- Dynamic, topological, ergodic, algebraic and combinatorial aspects
- Algorithmic, computability and complexity issues
- Information-theoretic aspects
- Emergent properties
- Formal languages
- Symbolic dynamics and connections to continuous systems
- Tilings, rewriting and substitution systems
- Computability theory
- Models of parallelism and distributed systems
- Asynchronous versus asynchronous models
- Applications CA and DCS
- CA in machine and deep learning


### Important Dates

See [Important Dates](/dates.html).


### Paper Categories

There are three categories of submission -- full papers, exploratory papers and extended abstracts. Full papers are meant to report more complete and denser research, while the later submission deadline for exploratory papers and extended abstract allows quick reporting of recent discoveries, work-in-progress and/or partial results. Submissions in the full paper category are refereed and selected by the program committee. Papers in the exploratory and extended abstracts category go through a less rigorous evaluation process. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference.

## Steering, Program, and Organizing Committees

See [Committees](/committees.html)

### Submission

See [Submission Instructions](/submission.html)


### Proceedings

Accepted full papers will appear in the proceedings published by Springer in the IFIP LNCS Series. Exploratory papers and extended abstracts will not be included in the LNCS proceedings, but will be published as local proceedings and uploaded on an open access repository.


### Journal Special Issue

It is planned that extended version of some selected papers will be considered for publication in special issues of an international renown journal.
