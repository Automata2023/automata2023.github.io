## AUTOMATA 2023
_29th International Workshop on Cellular Automata and Discrete Complex Systems (AUTOMATA 2023)_

** University of Trieste **

**Trieste, Italy**

**August 30 -- September 1**


### Scope

Papers presenting original and unpublished research on all fundamental aspects of cellular automata (CA), affine/correlated models of automata (such as automata networks, finite automata over finite/infinite words, picture languages), and related discrete complex systems (DCS) are sought.

Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):
- Dynamic, topological, ergodic, algebraic and combinatorial aspects
- Algorithmic, computability and complexity issues
- Information-theoretic aspects
- Emergent properties
- Formal languages
- Symbolic dynamics and connections to continuous systems
- Tilings, rewriting and substitution systems
- Computability theory
- Models of parallelism and distributed systems
- Asynchronous versus asynchronous models
- Applications CA and DCS
- CA in machine and deep learning


### Important Dates

- Submission deadline (full papers): April 21, 2023
- Notification (full papers): June 9, 2023
- Camera ready (full papers): June 2023, 2023
- Submission deadline (exploratory papers and extended abstracts): July 7, 2023
- Notification (exploratory papers and extended abstracts): July 14, 2023
- Camera ready (exploratory papers and extended abstracts): July 28, 2023
- AUTOMATA 2023: August 30 - September 1, 2023


### Paper Categories

There are three categories of submission -- full papers, exploratory papers and extended abstracts. Full papers are meant to report more complete and denser research, while the later submission deadline for exploratory papers and extended abstract allows quick reporting of recent discoveries, work-in-progress and/or partial results. Submissions in the full paper category are refereed and selected by the program committee. Papers in the exploratory and extended abstracts category go through a less rigorous evaluation process. All accepted papers must be presented at the conference.

- Luca Mariot (chair)
- Giulia Bernardini


### Submission

Authors are invited to submit papers of no more than 12 pages (for full papers), 8 pages (for exploratory papers) or 4 pages (for extended abstracts) via the [EasyChair system](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=automata2023)

Submissions should contain original research that has not previously been published. Concurrent submissions to other conferences/journals are not allowed. Supplementary material that exceeds the above mentioned page limits may be included as an appendix and will be considered at the committee's discretion (note that appendices will not be published in the proceedings). Submission must be formatted in LaTeX using the [LNCS format](http://www.springer.com/computer/lncs/lncs+authors) and submitted in Portable Document Format (PDF). Papers authored or co-authored by PC members are also welcome and will follow a specific evaluation process.


### Proceedings

Accepted full papers will appear in the proceedings published by Springer in the IFIP LNCS Series. Exploratory papers and extended abstracts will not be included in the LNCS proceedings, but will be published as local proceedings and uploaded on an open access repository.


### Journal Special Issue

It is planned that extended version of some selected papers will be considered for publication in special issues of an international renown journal.
